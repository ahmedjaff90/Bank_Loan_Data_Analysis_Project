# Bank Loan Data Analysis Project

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into loan performance and borrower behavior. The analysis was conducted using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends. The data was retrieved from Microsoft SQL Server using SQL, then processed and analyzed for reporting purposes.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation. (Version: September 2023)
SQL: Used to retrieve and manage data from Microsoft SQL Server.
Microsoft SQL Server: For database management. (Version: 19.0)
Microsoft Excel: For preliminary data analysis and manipulation. (Version: 2021)

# Dashboards

# 1. Summary Dashboard
The Summary Dashboard provides a high-level view of the bank's loan portfolio, showing metrics like:

Total Loan Applications (including Month-to-Date and Month-over-Month trends)
Total Funded Amount
Total Amount Received
Average Interest Rate
Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
Breakdown of Good Loans vs. Bad Loans with KPIs and performance analysis


# 2. Overview Dashboard
The Overview Dashboard focuses on visualizing trends and distributions, using:

Monthly Loan Applications (Line Chart) to identify seasonality and trends
Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map) to assess lending activities across different regions
Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart) and Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart) to explore loan distribution by term lengths and purposes
Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart) and Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map) to study borrower characteristics

# 3. Details Dashboard
The Details Dashboard offers a comprehensive and user-friendly grid view of all key loan metrics, including:

Loan IDs
Borrower information
Loan status
Funding and repayment details This dashboard helps users quickly access and analyze loan data in detail.


# Data Processing
The data used in this project was extracted using SQL queries from Microsoft SQL Server. This data was then analyzed and visualized using Power BI to create interactive dashboards that provide insights into the loan portfolio, borrower characteristics, and loan performance.


# Key Metrics Analyzed
Loan ID: A unique identifier for each loan
Address State: The borrower's location
Employment Length: Duration of the borrower's employment
Loan Grade: Risk classification of the loan
Home Ownership: Borrower's housing status
Loan Amount: Total amount borrowed
Interest Rate: The cost of borrowing
Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): A measure of the borrower's ability to manage debt
Loan Status: Current status of the loan (e.g., fully paid, default)


# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the bank's loan portfolio, borrower behavior, and loan performance. The use of SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization ensures a thorough analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making.
